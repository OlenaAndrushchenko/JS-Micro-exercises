        <h3>Exercises</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Write a program that writes a text of type <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> on the screen that says “Hello Javascript”.</li>
            <li>Write a program that writes on the screen “The sum of 3 + 5 is &lt;result&gt;”.</li>
            <li>Write a program that asks for the user's name with an input and writes a text that says “Hello &lt;user-name&gt;”.</li>
            <li>Write a program that asks for two numbers and writes “The sum of &lt;number-one&gt; with &lt;number-two&gt; is &lt;result&gt;”.</li>
            <li>Write a program that asks for two numbers and writes on the screen which one is the largest.</li>
            <li>Write a program that asks for 3 numbers and writes the largest of the three on the screen.</li>
            <li>Write a program that asks for a phrase and writes how many times the letter 'a' appears.</li>
            <li>Write a program that asks for a sentence and writes the vowels that appear.</li>
            <li>Write a program that asks for a sentence and writes how many vowels there are in the sentence.</li>
            <li>Write a program that asks for a sentence and writes how many times each of the vowels appears.</li>
            <li>Write a program that asks for a number and tells us if it is divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7 (check if it is divisible by one of the four).</li>
            <li>Add to the previous exercise that tells us by which of the four it is divisible (state all by which it is divisible).</li>
            <li>Write a program that writes on the screen the divisors of a given number.</li>
            <li>Write a program that writes on the screen the common divisors of two given numbers.</li>
            <li>Write a program that tells us if a given number is prime (it is not divisible by any number other than itself or the unit).</li>
